Some features for consideration:

- Board and game mechanics are required.

-Players, can be added iteratively:
  - Players in same browser: easiest
  - Players across browsers: nice
      * Nicer with server-push on turn change.
- Accounts, previous games (leaderboard): also nice
  - Spectators


- Run more than one game on server -> Done, persistent games in DB, with unique ID.
- Game logs
- Persistence is almost free with Play (I'll use in-memory for easy development here)
